JSwordlebot consists of 3 pages, regular wordle, a game to use the bot to solve your wordle and a game to go head to head against the wordle bot.
To calculate the next guess it tries every guess and figures out which guess on average narrows the word list. My algorithm isn't perfect, choosing the guess that minimizes the average size of the remaining words
list is not always the best play. The average number of guesses with this approach is 3.44 guesses, whereas the average with a perfect algorithm is 3.42
